# Kaggle
## Here are Some competetions I did in Kaggle


# Quick Draw Competetion
#### /DoodleRecognization 
    train a model that tell us what the picture(Doodle) is.
    This is the biggest challenge I did so far, the dataset is more than 70GB, and I tried several sophisticated model to reach the best performance as much as possible. In the end , I used ensemble to improve my model, which it did help
